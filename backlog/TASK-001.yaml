title: "Test GitHub Actions governance gate in real PR workflow"
description: |
  Validate the governance gate (templates/ci-cd/github-actions-governance-gate.yml)
  in HealthReporting by creating a test PR and verifying the gate runs correctly.
  This is the real-world validation step — confirm that drift detection, content
  quality checks, and CLAUDE.md validation work in an actual CI pipeline.
