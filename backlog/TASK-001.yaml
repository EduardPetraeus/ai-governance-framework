title: "Test GitHub Actions governance gate in real PR workflow"
description: |
  Validate the governance gate (templates/ci-cd/github-actions-governance-gate.yml)
  by deploying it in the ai-governance-framework repo itself (self-governing principle).
  The template was adapted (requirements-dev.txt instead of requirements.txt) and
  added as .github/workflows/governance-gate.yml. A PR was created to trigger the
  4-job gate (lint, test, security-scan, governance-check) in a real CI pipeline.
  Drift detection, content quality checks, and CLAUDE.md validation confirmed working.

  Originally planned for HealthReporting, but pivoted to self-governing principle:
  the governance framework validates itself. Tested in ai-governance-framework repo
  with adapted template (requirements-dev.txt). All 4 CI jobs confirmed working.
