# Changelog — v0.2.0

**Date:** 2026-02-28

This entry documents every addition made during the v0.2.0 expansion of the framework, which introduced multi-IDE and multi-CI support, a full automated test suite, four new automation scripts, an interactive CLI installer, and a governance health dashboard pipeline.

## New Automation Scripts (`automation/`)

- `governance_dashboard.py` — Generates `DASHBOARD.md` with a governance health score, session velocity trends, estimated cost trends, ADR coverage percentage, and sprint progress. Designed to run on a daily schedule via `.github/workflows/governance-health.yml`.
- `token_counter.py` — Estimates session token usage by analysing git history and session logs. Appends a dated entry to `COST_LOG.md` so token consumption can be tracked over time without manual logging.
- `adr_coverage_checker.py` — Scans `CHANGELOG.md` and `DECISIONS.md` for architectural decisions and cross-references them against the `docs/adr/` directory. Reports decisions that have not yet been captured as a formal ADR.
- `inherits_from_validator.py` — Validates the constitutional inheritance chain by comparing a project-level `CLAUDE.md` against its declared parent org or team constitution. Flags fields that have been removed or contradict the parent without an explicit override declaration.

## CLI Installer (`bin/`)

- `bin/ai-governance-init` — Interactive scaffolding wizard that asks for project type, team size, CI platform (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Bitbucket Pipelines, Azure DevOps), and IDE (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Aider, or none). Generates the correct `CLAUDE.md`, CI workflow files, and IDE configuration template for the selected combination. Requires Node.js 14 or later.

## Test Suite (`tests/`)

- 273 tests across 13 test files covering all automation scripts, naming convention enforcement, cross-reference integrity, template completeness, example file validity, and governance compliance checks.
- `tests/conftest.py` — Handles `sys.path` insertion for `automation/` and `scripts/` so all test files can import modules cleanly without installing the package.
- `.github/workflows/tests.yml` — CI workflow that runs the full test suite on Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 on every push and pull request.
- Coverage gate set at 80%. PRs that drop coverage below this threshold fail CI.

## Multi-IDE Support (`templates/`)

- `templates/cursor-rules.md` — Governance rules formatted for Cursor IDE's `.cursor/rules` configuration. Covers security constraints, naming conventions, and the session protocol in Cursor's instruction format.
- `templates/copilot-instructions.md` — Governance rules formatted for GitHub Copilot's `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Includes security rules, output format constraints, and session discipline equivalents.
- `templates/windsurf-rules.md` — Governance rules formatted for Windsurf IDE. Structured to match Windsurf's AI instruction conventions while preserving full framework compliance.
- `templates/aider-conventions.md` — Governance conventions for Aider, covering commit discipline, file scope boundaries, and the session start/end protocol adapted for Aider's CLI-first workflow.
- `templates/DASHBOARD.md` — Output format template for the governance health dashboard generated by `automation/governance_dashboard.py`. Contains all dashboard sections with realistic default values.

## Multi-CI Support (`ci-cd/`)

- `ci-cd/gitlab/` — GitLab CI pipeline with three workflow files: `.gitlab-ci.yml` (main governance check and CHANGELOG enforcement), `ai-review.yml` (AI-assisted PR review stage), and `tests.yml` (Python test suite integration).
- `ci-cd/circleci/` — CircleCI governance pipeline implementing the same governance checks as the GitHub Actions canonical implementation, adapted to CircleCI's orb and job configuration format.
- `ci-cd/bitbucket/` — Bitbucket Pipelines governance workflow with CHANGELOG enforcement and naming convention checks in Bitbucket's `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` format.
- `ci-cd/azure-devops/` — Azure DevOps governance pipeline implemented as an Azure Pipelines YAML file, with equivalent governance check, AI review, and test stages.

## New Documentation (`docs/`)

- `docs/multi-ide-support.md` — Feature comparison matrix showing which governance features are supported across all five IDE integrations. Includes a migration guide for teams switching IDE tooling mid-project.
- `docs/metrics-guide.md` — Defines the governance metrics and KPIs tracked by the framework: health score, session velocity, ADR coverage, cost per session, and drift frequency. Includes calculation methods and target ranges by maturity level.
- `docs/compliance-guide.md` — Guidance for regulated industries on using the framework to generate audit trails. Covers GDPR, SOC 2, and ISO 27001 alignment, with instructions for configuring the framework to produce compliance-ready session logs.

## Governance Health Dashboard

- `.github/workflows/governance-health.yml` — Scheduled GitHub Actions workflow that runs daily, invokes `automation/governance_dashboard.py`, and commits the updated `DASHBOARD.md` to the repository. Provides a continuously current governance health view without manual intervention.
- `automation/governance_dashboard.py` generates the full dashboard markdown, including health score trend, session velocity, cost log summary, ADR coverage, and sprint progress from `SPRINT_LOG.md`.
- `templates/DASHBOARD.md` is the canonical output format. The generator writes to this file in place.

## Cross-Reference Fixes

- All relative links across all `.md` files in the repository were audited and corrected. Several broken links in `docs/session-protocol.md`, `docs/constitutional-inheritance.md`, and `agents/README.md` were repaired.
- `tests/test_cross_references.py` added to the CI test suite to detect broken relative links automatically on every push. This prevents cross-reference regressions from being introduced undetected.
